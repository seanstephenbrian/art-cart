# ArtCart

**artcart** is a demo online store built with react. the app includes shopping cart functionality, 
a searchable catalog, dynamic page routing, and a tongue-in-cheek contemporary art market theme.

shop inventory data is stored in a json file and accessed/processed as necessary using asynchronous 
methods in component hooks.

the shopping cart display dynamically updates as the state of the user's cart changes, 
automatically generating tax and shipping based on the items in the cart.

please shop the catalog - i hope you find a masterpiece to add to your collection!
